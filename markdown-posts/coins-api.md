This blog is about part of Pedrotech's youtube video called **NextJS Course For Beginners - Routes, Fetching, SSR, SSG...** about using an API via *Axios*, which starts at about 38 minutes in. 

The complete video is an excellent introduction to NextJS in less than an hour.

Note that there is a [github repo](https://github.com/machadop1407/nextjs-course) associated with the video.
