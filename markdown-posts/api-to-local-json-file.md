Was hoping that [NextJS docs on API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) would have a page where data would be shown after being fetched via the api.

So, looking elsewhere, there's [Next.js Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P8mASSREYM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgC9mj0qv972IO5DmD-H0ZH) by Codevolution, and in the particular the sequence from 40-48.

This is **Next.js Tutorial - 41 - API Routes** which is 8:00 minutes long, from 25 Jul 2021.
